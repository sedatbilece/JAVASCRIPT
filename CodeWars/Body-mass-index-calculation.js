/*
For long period JavaScript warriors trained a lot in coding kata. But to find way warrior also need physical kata. Some of warriors forgot about this fact and enemies can use this weakness, your clan is under threat. You are chosen to fix this situation. Write a function to calculate Body mass index for each warrior.

bmi = weight / (height*height)

where weight is in kg and height is in meters
Warriors know only their height (in centimetres) and weight (in kilogrames). Your task is to return an object with fields

value - calculated Body mass index, as a string, rounded to the first decimal.

category - related category, as a string (from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index ; see below). Note: determine the category before rounding the BMI.

Ex :

calculateBmi(65,175)
returns: {value: "21.2", category: "Normal (healthy weight)"}
A constant DATA is preloaded for you. It contains the names of all the categories and their boundaries:

from (kg) is inclusive.
to (kg) is exclusive.
